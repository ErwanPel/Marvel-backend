## Overview

This project is a technical test carried out at the "Le RÃ©acteur" bootcamp. This project respects a specification for the functionalities and total freedom for the aesthetic and interactive aspect of the site. 
 

This project manages routes for :

1) user registration and connection.
2) Get a list of 100 characters or comics per page, in alphabetical order.
3) Get information on a specific character or comic.
4) Get a list of favorites.
5) Add or remove an item from the favorites list.

</br>

Backend development uses Node.js and Express.js / MongoDB servers for database management (mongoose package). This server uses 10 routes to perform the above tasks.

</br>
This project uses the Marvel API of bootcamp "Le Reacteur" and requires an API key to obtain the characters and comics.
The "isAuthenticated" middleware ensures that each user has a secure connection to the routes linked to their favorites.
For the "/comics" and "/characters" server routes, is it possible to filter the search result with the query "name" for "/characters" and "title" for "/comics".
